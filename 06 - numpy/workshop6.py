# workshop6.py  Lecture 6 workshop problems

# Solve the following problems using the numpy module.

# 1. Create a 2D array of zeros, of size (10,20).

# 2. Create a 2D array of size (5,10), where every entry is 100.
#    hint: Read the help for np.tile().

# 3. Create a 2D array of random integers between 1 and 10, of size (5,5).
#    hint: read the help for np.random.randint()

# 4. Repeat problem 3, but this time specify that the values in the array
#    should be of type np.int8.

# 5. Repeat problem 3, but this time make the array size (m,n),
#    where m and n are themselves random integers between 1 and 10. That is,
#    every time you create the array, it has a randomly generated size.

# 6. (a) Create a 2D array x of normally distributed random numbers, with
#        mean zero and standard deviation one. Make the array size (9,9).
#        hint: Use the function np.random.normal().
#    (b) Create a 2D array y that is a view of the central 3 x 3 square
#        of the array x that you created in part (a).
#        hint: Use the slice operations we covered in the lecture,
#        e.g., something like y = x[0:1,0:1]
#    (c) Set the values of y to zero (in place), and confirm that this also
#        changes the values of the central 3 x 3 square of x to zero.

# 7. (a) Write a function that creates an array that is an image of a circle,
#        where the pixels outside the circle have a value of zero, and the
#        pixels inside the circle have a value of one. Give the function
#        an argument 'size' that controls the size of the image in pixels, and
#        an argument 'radius' that controls the radius of the circle in pixels.
#        hint: Model your answer after the gabor() function that we created
#        in the lecture code.
#    (b) Use matplotlib's plot function to show an image of a circle created
#        using the function you wrote for part (a).
