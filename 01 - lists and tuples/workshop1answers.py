# workshop1answers.py Lecture 1 workshop problems, with solutions

# Add code below the following comments, to solve the stated problems.

# 1. Create a list x that contains the numbers 1 to 10.
x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]

# 2. Set a variable y equal to the following sublists of x. Where possible,
# write your code so that it works for any length of x, e.g., it still
# works if x has 20 elements rather than 10.

# 2a. the first element of x
y = x[0]

# 2b. the first five elements of x
y = x[:5]

# 2c. the last element of x
y = x[-1]

# 2d. the last five elements of x
y = x[-5:]
