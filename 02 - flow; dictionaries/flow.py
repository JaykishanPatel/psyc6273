# we use a for loop when we know at the outset how many times we'll
# need to go through the loop. for example, we usually know the number
# of trials we'll run in an experiment.
# 
# we use a while loop when we'll know when we're done with a loop, but
# not necessarily how many times it will take. for example, a participant
# in an experiment may press several keys before they press a key that
# is an allowed response.
