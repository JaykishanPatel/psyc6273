# workshop2.py  Lecture 2 workshop problems

# Add code below the following comments, to solve the stated problems.

# 1. Use a for loop to create a list that contains the squares of the
# integers 0 to 20.

# 2. Repeat problem 1, using a while loop instead of a for loop.

# 3. Repeat problem 1, using a list comprehension instead of a for loop.

# 4. Rank the solutions in problems 1 to 3 from best to worst. Explain
# why you ranked the solutions the way you did.

# 5. (a) Use a list comprehension to make a list of 200 simulated reaction
# times in a perceptual experiment. Make the reaction times normally distributed,
# with a mean of 0.75 and a standard deviation of 0.25.
# (b) Count the number of reaction times less than 0.25.
# (c) Count the number of reaction times less than 0.25 or greater than 1.25.

# 6. Create a list with 100 elements. Each element of the list is a tuple
# with two elements. The first element of each tuple is a random number
# from the interval [0,1). The second element of each tuple is a random
# number drawn from the interval [0,1), with the constraint that the second
# element is greater than the first element. (So actually the second element
# is a sample from [x,1), where x is the first element.)
